# Field Operations: Vehicle-Mounted VM

The '99 Rav4 conversion rattled down the forest service road, its suspension protesting every rut and rock. I'd chosen this route deliberately—cell service disappeared about 3 miles back, and satellite coverage was spotty at best under the dense Douglas fir canopy. Perfect conditions for field testing.

The VM sat in a custom housing bolted to where the passenger airbag used to be. Eli, my mechanic, had fabricated the mount from scrap aluminum and lined it with the same ferrite material used in MRI rooms. The whole setup looked janky as hell, but it had survived two years of field work, including that time in Vladivostok when I had to ditch the car into the harbor. The VM had stayed dry even as the cabin filled with seawater.

I pulled over at a small clearing and killed the engine. Through the windshield, I could see Mount Rainier looming white and distant above the tree line. My fingers brushed across the VM's matte surface, the quantum chip inside imperceptible to the touch yet containing what some religious types called "the bounded infinity." A slight vibration, barely noticeable, hummed beneath my fingertips—the supercooling system keeping the quantum elements stable.

"Let's see what you've got today," I murmured, powering up the field interface.

The interface was deliberately primitive—monochrome e-ink display, physical control wheel, three LED indicators for system status. Nothing that could compromise the VM's integrity. As always, it took exactly 12 seconds to boot, no matter what. Time invariance, they called it. The boot time wasn't processing—it was a synchronization interval with the time-plane.

The display flickered, and coordinates appeared:

```
47.382, -121.448
+3.14 km bearing 241°
PAYSTREAM POTENTIAL: $3,200-$5,800
TEMPORAL VARIANCE: MINIMAL
MORAL VALENCE: +2.3
```

I checked my topo map. The coordinates pointed to an empty stretch of forest about two miles southwest of my position. No trails, no roads, nothing of note. But the VM was never wrong.

The paystream potential wasn't huge, but the moral valence was solidly positive. Some Department agents ignored anything below +3.0, but I'd learned that the smaller interventions sometimes created the most interesting temporal ripples. 

I grabbed my pack, slid the handheld VM terminal into its waterproof case, and locked the car. The forest service road continued roughly in the right direction for another mile. After that, I'd be bushwhacking. 

As I hiked, I considered the temporal variance reading. "Minimal" meant whatever I was about to do existed close to the central current of the time-plane, with few divergent possibilities. Those were usually the easiest jobs, but occasionally misleading. Sometimes the smallest deviations had the most profound consequences in distant dimensions of time.

The forest thickened as I left the road, forcing me to navigate around fallen trees and dense undergrowth. My boots sank into the moss, leaving temporary impressions that slowly refilled behind me. I thought about how those footprints were like minor perturbations in the time-plane—present for a moment, then absorbed back into the main flow, leaving no lasting trace.

After forty minutes of hiking, the handheld terminal vibrated. I was close. I stopped and surveyed the area. Nothing but trees, moss, and the occasional bird call. I rotated slowly, holding the terminal out like a dowsing rod, until the vibration intensified. Twenty more yards in that direction.

I pushed through a thicket of salmonberry bushes and found myself at the edge of a small clearing. In the center stood a weather monitoring station—a simple metal pole with various sensors and a small solar panel. It looked like standard Forest Service equipment, certainly nothing unusual enough to trigger the VM.

The terminal now pulsed with a steady rhythm. This was it. Whatever difference I was supposed to make, it was here. I approached the weather station carefully, inspecting it for anything unusual. The solar panel was covered with a thin layer of pollen and bird droppings, reducing its efficiency. The anemometer cup was slightly bent, probably from a branch falling on it. Otherwise, everything seemed functional.

I checked the terminal again for additional information:

```
ACTION VECTOR: MAINTENANCE/VERIFICATION
OUTCOME PROBABILITY: 87%
```

Maintenance. That was all? I was supposed to clean a weather station? The Department typically didn't concern itself with routine environmental monitoring, unless...

I wiped down the solar panel with a microfiber cloth from my pack and straightened the anemometer cup as best I could. Then I found the access panel and checked the data card—it was nearly full. I replaced it with a blank one from my kit (we always carried various memory formats for exactly this reason) and pocketed the original.

As soon as I snapped the access panel closed, the terminal displayed new information:

```
VERIFICATION COMPLETE
PAYSTREAM ACTIVE: $4,185
TEMPORAL WAVE FRONT: 14 MONTHS
MORAL VALENCE: ADJUSTED TO +3.1
```

The paystream had activated, and the funds would be in my account by morning. More interesting was the temporal wave front—fourteen months was unusually specific. Most paystreams had vague temporal impacts that rippled outward from the point of intervention. This one had a defined forward boundary.

I sat on a fallen log and examined the data card. Using the terminal's basic interface, I could see the station had been recording temperature, humidity, wind speed, and particulate matter for the past three years. The last six months showed a subtle but consistent anomaly—nighttime temperature spikes that didn't correlate with any weather pattern.

The Department didn't care about weather itself. But it cared deeply about accurate world state information. This station was feeding data to climate models, which in turn informed policy decisions, which shaped the trajectory of human civilization. Some subtle error in this isolated station had created a vulnerability in the time-plane fourteen months from now—a point where some critical decision might be made based on flawed information.

By ensuring the station's accuracy and preserving the evidence of tampering (for that's what the anomalous readings surely were), I'd closed a potential branch point where reality might veer toward a darker outcome.

As I hiked back to my car, I wondered who had tampered with the station and why. Corrupt logging interests? Climate denialists? Or simply a random act of boredom by hikers passing through? The VM didn't specify, and it didn't matter. The time-plane was indifferent to intentions—it responded only to actions and their consequences across dimensions.

The Rav4's engine turned over on the first try, and I pulled back onto the forest service road. The VM on the dashboard displayed a new set of coordinates before I'd gone half a mile.

```
48.092, -122.698
+67.2 km bearing 315°
PAYSTREAM POTENTIAL: $27,000-$42,000
TEMPORAL VARIANCE: SIGNIFICANT
MORAL VALENCE: +4.8
```

This was a big one—high payout, high moral valence, and significant temporal variance. Something that could branch the time-plane in meaningful ways. And not too far away—just up near the Olympic Peninsula.

I checked my watch. Still plenty of daylight left. I could make it there by sunset, find a place to sleep in the car, and start fresh in the morning. The gas gauge showed three-quarters full.

As I accelerated onto the main highway, I caught a glimpse of myself in the rearview mirror. Three years ago, I'd been monitoring an election, watching people make choices they believed would shape their futures. Now I was driving around the backwoods fixing weather stations and who knows what else, shaping those same futures in ways none of those voters could imagine.

The Ministry—wherever and whenever it existed—had figured out something profound about reality: democracy, technology, and human intention were all just inputs to the real governing system of our world—the multidimensional mathematics of consequence that flowed through time like water through a watershed. The Department was just maintaining the pipes.

I turned on the radio, catching a news report about ongoing climate negotiations. The anchor's voice faded in and out as I drove through patches of poor reception.

"...representatives remain deadlocked over emissions targets for the Pacific Northwest region, with economic concerns from the timber industry..."

I smiled. In fourteen months, someone would make a different decision because of what I'd just done. The math would shift slightly, the moral vector would bend toward a better outcome, and no one would ever know why.

Just another day in the Department.
