## Intro

I still don't know who, where, or even *when* my salary comes from. But it's a good living. The paystreams I find are usually pretty stable, and changes have always been in my favor. I don't know anyone who would complain about median Department rates these days, that's for sure. 

I started fishing about 3 years ago, right in the middle of the whole Cali/Cascadia secession drama. In retrospect, just by luck, I suppose you could say I was at the *exact* center of the drama. I stumbled into a temporary gig as an election monitor in south Tacoma. Right up until the riot shields and antidrone ray-guns came out, I witnessed a remarkably free and fair election play out with nothing but papers, no. 2 pencils, and all the repurposed testing Scantrons from every public school in the pacific northwest (and some from Norcal and Idaho).

The technocrats from Cali called it hopeless decelerationism, but I always thought the "slow-tech or no-tech" campaign was a brilliant way to build trust with people who had in their lifetimes been betrayed three times over by silicon, fibre, and crypto. If your vote is going to actually influence your world for the first time in 16 years, you can't leave it to 'experts' to tell you that it works, or to 'technology' that promises to do the work for you; you've got to feel it yourself, in your bones, with your people. To create trust, use trusty tools. To verify, use your common senses. The Cascadia Interim Executive Council was idealistic to a fault, but they knew their people and were clear on their values. 

In a Puyallup middle school I ate a cardboard bagel and sipped powder-creamed coffee while watching some PLU students put the last roll of chicken wire onto a big faraday cage that sat in the center of the gymnasium. On top of a floor covered with tin foil 13 scantrons set onto folding tables, each with a plastic USPS crate underneath labeled with a hastily applied color-coded label: < OUT / COUNTED >. If all went according to plan, only 8 of the machines would be in use at any moment over the 6 day counting period, but any voter had the right to request a random substitution with the machines "on the bench", and would roll a pair of dice to pick a new one (another person would flip a coin to select which die). 

The array of scantrons was a vote matrix. The system had come out of the early DAO days as a clever mechanism for converting A or B preferences into meaningful budget line-items.

The 4th and 5th grade classrooms in the adjacent building had been converted into polling centers and ballot seminars, where educational sessions were held the whole month prior to the vote, allowing anyone to come in and learn about the process, ask questions, and talk with each other about their picks for Governor, cabinet, ambassadors, or about any of the 16 budgets assigned to this polling center. To older Americans it was a confusing and time-intensive new way to exercise an old right, but that generation had no shortage of time.  

Now that voting was under way, the classrooms were organized into two general groups: "traditional", and "direct" voting rooms. Traditional rooms […]



[Cascadia Paper BudgetBox]

The "ring" was supposed to be observed at all times by no fewer than 21 people, who could watch the voting/counting process from any angle they liked outside the cage. Most sat on the wooden folding bleachers opposite the entry/exit cues, but there were folding chairs scattered around here and there, and a snack table for observers underneath a tattered basketball net on the far side. Here and there some folks had set up tripods oversized for the tiny 360* cameras they supported six feet off the ground. 

A long line of early voters had already formed outside the gymnasium doors, and the official start time of 8am had passed 33 minutes ago, but the volunteer staff were steadfast and calm in their final checks. The district lead for this station had already gone outside to announce that doors works open no later than 9. He now walked over with a worn triangular wood block, pressed the waist-level metal bar, and after setting the doorstop in, welcomed the first voters into the gym.

I watched the slow trod of voters mill through the hall […]







A wise old soul taught me something called *the perfect cast*. It goes Left, left, right, up down […] and let rrrr rip! 




## mechanics

Funding comes from the largest cluster of zkapital pools on the net. These enormous asset pools zk-fund all sorts of projects, both public and private. Upstream of outcomes is the world state. As the state of the world changes, the world state object is updated. Most of this updating is automated or mechanized in some way, but occasionally new paystreams open up for bespoke manual verification.

In-between the world state and the outcomes contact is the values matrix, informally called "the dark forest", and naturally the domain of the Department.

The values matrix is important because within its bounded infinity are vectors that together define how the world ends. Or, depending on your philosophical outlook: how it might end, how it could end, how it does end. The funny thing about the values matrix is that it is an causal/temporal invariant. It's a quantum chip, wired into several dimensions that are difficult to grasp, and from our limited perspective in time, a synced VM never changes. Whenever you give it a "real" input, after some filtering and transformation, you'll discover that the "right" output is there — and more eerily, *it always has been*. 

The chips are expensive (getting cheaper), but if you posses one and sync the world state once, your values matrix will always be the same, *without the need to sync again*. A node with the Values Matrix might forget the state of the world, but the VM will always give you outputs that can be checked against the outcomes contract for a paystream. Even as it remains 'disconnected' from any network. 

>The term 'ansible' has been debated as a name for an air-gapped VM on Reddit because the tech implies faster-than-light communication, but it's not a very interesting one, and won't be until time-dilation is a true hurdle for scheduling meetings. 

>Those pricks at the Ministry refer to a node setup like mine as "Kant's Ansible"— and 

There's no way to run a real VM in non-quantum architectures, but mappings in the outcomes contract can be computed directly from an updated world state object. It's expensive and slow, but synced consensus over the state of the world is pretty hard to do with legacy compute. Fortunately Idle data centers around the world sit like zombie shopping malls after the quantum crash; they have flops to spare and there's honest money in hosting honest state providers, if not dishonest money in running fake ones. 

In the early days of discovery, there were a few hedge funds that tried to use the nodes for what you might call "white collar time arbitrage", but it's a fools errand now. One by one, *every* hedge fund that tried to mess with time was undone. They made lots of money until the black swan came for them. It was uncanny; many 'thought leaders' weighed in on the eerie coordination of not just capital supply but *radical shifts in consumer demands* so systematically and completely crushing the (de)financal establishment. 

But the real power of the VM, as you might imagine, is the ability to bring the node into the field, where full sync is impossible, and *try stuff* to see if you can find any new paystreams that open up as a result of your changes to the state of the world. If you calibrate the dimensions of your hypercert *just right*, one can just do things and follow the money. 

> Before his tragic passing, Eliezer Yudokowsky famously called the VM "Kant's Ansible". 


I don't actually know how it all works I'm happy to accept the eli5 "hamd-wavy" version: 

The dark forestry department is not of a country, international organization, or multinational organization. It reports to a ministry that does not yet exist, from our perspective in time. Nevertheless, this ministry does exist*, and it has phenomenal resources. Like, ridiculous, stupid amounts of money and information. Unfortunately, insofar as money and information are the same thing, this is all it has. Land, minerals, energy, or corporeal agency are not assets that it can tap into. It can only inform, incentivise, and influence.

* One widely published hypothesis is the 'forking paths' interpretation: the ministry is an inter dimensional agency— if a world-ending event "happens" on that department's branch (that branch's department?), somehow all *other* timelines update their value matrix, and activities that prevent that apocalypse in other timelines become more lucrative. Because the VM is bigger than our temporal perspective, the "updated" VM always was that way from our perspective. 
* This is a much preferred explanation to the simulation hypothesis, in which we are just agents in a model of the "real" world somewhere, and the values matrix is our seed starting conditions. 

Anyways the VM is a valuable module to hold; it doesn't draw too much power, there are a few clever fab files for pairing with a raspberry pi, NAS, or similar setups. One favorite of mine is a vehicle mount on an old 2000's Rav4 electric conversion.
