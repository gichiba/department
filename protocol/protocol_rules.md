# Protocol Rules for Writers

Welcome to the collaborative writing process for "The Department of Dark Forestry" universe. This guide outlines the principles and practices that help us maintain a cohesive, imaginative world through our collective efforts.

## Content Organization Philosophy

The project organizes content into distinct directories, each with its own purpose:

- **protocol/** contains meta-level guidelines about the writing process itself
- **world/** houses in-world canonical elements, rules, and descriptions
- **fragments/** stores raw creative elements and inspirational pieces
- **drafts/** holds temporary narrative assemblies

This separation helps us maintain clarity between writing about the world (the writer's perspective) and writing from within the world (the world's perspective).

## Maintaining Consistency

Consistency is vital to creating an immersive fictional universe:

- Before adding new content, familiarize yourself with existing canon in the `world/` directory
- When you encounter potential contradictions with established canon, explicitly note them for discussion
- As you develop new canonical elements (mechanisms, rules, locations, etc.), document them appropriately in the `world/` directory

## Creative Contribution Process

Follow this general workflow when contributing:

1. **Explore the Canon**: Read through the existing files in `world/` to understand the established universe
2. **Create New Content**: Draft new material that builds upon and respects established rules
3. **Extract Canon**: Identify new canonical elements from your work and suggest how they should be formalized
4. **Refine the Process**: Share insights about the collaborative experience to improve our writing guidelines

## Style Guidelines

To maintain a unified voice and vision:

- When writing in-world content, adopt the perspective of someone within that world
- Use consistent terminology across all documents (refer to the style guide)
- Focus on systems, mechanisms, and environments rather than highlighting exceptional individuals
- Follow structural and formatting patterns established in similar document types
- Consult `protocol/style_guide.md` for detailed style specifications

### Handling Style Inconsistencies

When you notice style inconsistencies:

1. Document the specific inconsistency with clear examples
2. If an existing guideline applies, use it to resolve the inconsistency
3. If no guideline exists:
   - Propose a solution that aligns with existing style principles
   - Suggest an amendment to the style guide
   - Include a clear description, explicit guideline, and example

## Working with Fragments

Fragments represent the raw creative material of our universe:

- Once verified, fragments in `fragments/` are considered immutable canon
- Human writers are encouraged to contribute fragments as creative sparks
- When working with fragments, extract key concepts to document in `world/`

## Creating Drafts

Drafts allow us to experiment with narrative structures:

- Place all drafts in the `drafts/` directory
- Ensure drafts respect the constraints and rules defined in `world/`
- Use drafts to explore implications of established mechanisms
- Follow the naming convention: `[number]-[concept]-fragment.md`
- Remember to decompose interesting drafts into new fragments for future inspiration
