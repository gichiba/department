# Temporal Funding & World State

Funding comes from the largest cluster of zkapital pools on the net. These enormous asset pools zk-fund all sorts of projects, both public and private. Upstream of outcomes is the world state. As the state of the world changes, the world state object is updated. Most of this updating is automated or mechanized in some way, but occasionally new paystreams open up for bespoke manual verification.

In-between the world state and the outcomes contact is the values matrix, informally called "the dark forest", and naturally the domain of the Department.

I don't actually know how it all works; I'm happy to accept the eli5 "hand-wavy" version: 

The dark forestry department is not of a country, international organization, or multinational organization. It might not even yet exist, from our perspective in time. Nevertheless, the Department does *exist* somewherewhen, and it has phenomenal resources. Like, ridiculous, stupid amounts of money and information. Unfortunately, insofar as money and information are the same thing, this is all it has. Land, minerals, energy, or corporeal agency are not assets that it can tap into. It can only inform, incentivise, and influence.

One widely published hypothesis is the 'forking paths' interpretation: the ministry is an inter dimensional agencyâ€” if a world-ending event "happens" on that department's branch (that branch's department?), somehow all *other* timelines update their value matrix, and activities that prevent that apocalypse in other timelines become more lucrative. Because the VM is bigger than our temporal perspective, the "updated" VM always was that way from our vantage point. This is a much preferred explanation to the simulation hypothesis, in which we are just agents in a model of the "real" world somewhere, and the values matrix is our seed starting conditions.
