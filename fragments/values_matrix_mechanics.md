# Values Matrix Mechanics

The values matrix is important because within its bounded infinity are vectors that together define how the world ends. Or, depending on your philosophical outlook: how it might end, how it could end, how it does end.

The the values matrix is technically called a causal/temporal invariant; it's a quantum chip keeping tabs on more dimensions than we can see. From our limited perspective in time, a synced VM never changes. Whenever you give it a "real" input, after some filtering and transformation, you'll discover that the "right" output is there â€” and more eerily, *it always has been there*. 

The chips are expensive (getting cheaper), but if you posses one and sync the world state once, your values matrix will always be the same, *without the need to sync again*. A node with the Values Matrix might forget the state of the world, but the VM will always give you outputs that can later be checked against the outcomes contract for a paystream. Even as it remains 'disconnected' from any network.

## World State

There's no way to run a real VM in non-quantum architectures, but mappings in the outcomes contract can be computed directly from an updated world state object. It's expensive and slow, but synced consensus over the state of the world is pretty hard to do with legacy compute. Fortunately Idle data centers around the world sit like zombie shopping malls after the quantum crash; they have flops to spare and there's honest money in hosting honest state providers, if not dishonest money in running fake ones. 

In the early days of discovery, there were a few hedge funds that tried to use the nodes for what you might call "white collar time arbitrage", but it's a fools errand now. One by one, *every* hedge fund that tried to mess with time was undone. They made lots of money until the black swan came for them. It was uncanny; many 'thought leaders' weighed in on the eerie coordination of not just capital supply but *radical shifts in consumer demands* so systematically and completely crushing the (de)financal establishment. 

But the real power of the VM, as you might imagine, is the ability to bring the node into the field, where full sync is impossible, and *try stuff* to see if you can find any new paystreams that open up as a result of your changes to the state of the world. If you calibrate the dimensions of your hypercert *just right*, one can just do things and follow the money.
