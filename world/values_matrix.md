# The Values Matrix (VM)

## Definition
* The Values Matrix is a quantum computational system containing vectors that define possible futures within its bounded infinity
* It exists as a causal/temporal invariant - a quantum chip keeping tabs on more dimensions than we can see
* From our limited perspective in time, a synced VM never changes - whenever you give it a "real" input, after some filtering and transformation, you'll discover that the "right" output is there â€” and more eerily, *it always has been there*

## Properties
1. **Quantum Nature**: Functions exclusively on quantum architectures, cannot be run on conventional computing systems - there's no way to run a real VM in non-quantum architectures
2. **Temporal Invariance**: A synced VM never changes from the user's perspective. A node with the Values Matrix might forget the state of the world, but the VM will always give you outputs that can later be checked against the outcomes contract for a paystream.
3. **Air-Gap Functionality**: Continues to generate valid outputs even when disconnected from all networks - even as it remains 'disconnected' from any network
4. **Perspective-Based Function**: Depending on one's perspective, the VM reveals different patterns - some use it to prevent bad outcomes, others to incentivize positive change

## Physical Implementation
1. VM chips are physical quantum devices that can be:
   * Implemented in various form factors (portable, vehicle-mounted)
   * Synced once with the world state, without the need to sync again
   * Operated independently thereafter
   * Expensive (getting cheaper)

## Operations & Integration
* Mappings in the outcomes contract can be computed directly from an updated world state object - it's expensive and slow
* Synced consensus over the state of the world is pretty hard to do with legacy compute
* Idle data centers around the world sit like zombie shopping malls after the quantum crash; they have flops to spare
* There's honest money in hosting honest state providers, if not dishonest money in running fake ones

## Loose Canon
* Some agents in a different agency called "the Ministry" refer to a portable node setup as "Kant's Ansible"
