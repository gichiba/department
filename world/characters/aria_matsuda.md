# Aria Matsuda

## Basic Information
* **Name:** Aria Matsuda
* **Age:** 34
* **Location:** Portland, Oregon (formerly Tokyo)
* **Role:** Temporal Analysis Specialist / Field Observer
* **Status:** Active

## Background
* **Origin:** Audio engineer who specialized in archival restoration of analog recordings. Documented a strange acoustic anomaly during the collapse of the Cali/Cascadia conflict that preceded a major digital infrastructure failure by exactly 73 seconds. The Department recruited her after discovering her analysis of the event posted on an obscure forum dedicated to temporal coincidences.
* **Key Life Events:** 
  * At age 16, recovered and restored her grandfather's reel-to-reel recordings from 1960s Tokyo, discovering they contained conversations that seemingly predicted events 50 years into the future
  * During the Cali/Cascadia aftermath, was trapped for four days in a recording studio bunker with nothing but analog equipment when the grid and communications networks failed
  * Became the first person to document the "spectral echo" pattern now used by the Department to identify potential farfetching locations
* **Education/Training:** Masters in Audio Engineering from Tokyo University of the Arts; self-taught in spectral analysis and temporal sound theory; Department field training (ongoing)

## Profile
* **Specialty:** Acoustic chronometry - the measurement and analysis of time through sound
* **Secondary Skills:** Fluent in Japanese and English, electrical engineering, analog-to-digital conversion, improvised recording techniques
* **Anachronism:** Uses a modified Soviet-era Nagra III reel-to-reel recorder (1960s) retrofitted with modern components that she maintains herself
* **Personal Tension:** Logic vs. Intuition - struggles between trusting her analytical methods and the unexplainable intuitive "feeling" that guides her most accurate predictions

## Department Relationship
* **Classification:** Field Observer, Clearance Level 3
* **Time Active:** 8 months
* **Handler/Reports to:** Director Elaine Chen, Western North American Division
* **Notable Assignments:** 
  * Documented the "Vancouver Resonance" (her first official farfetching)
  * Analyzed acoustic properties of three historical farfetchings from Department archives
  * Currently tracking temporal disturbances throughout former Cascadia territories

## Equipment
* **Signature Tool:** Modified Nagra III reel-to-reel recorder with custom temporal filtering circuits
* **Other Tools:** 
  * Set of tuning forks calibrated to resonate at frequencies associated with temporal disturbances
  * Vintage Sony ECM-999 stereo microphone (1970s)
  * Hand-built spectral visualizer (portable, battery-powered)
  * Mechanical Seiko chronometer with custom modifications
* **Department Issue:** 
  * Standard Department field kit (secure communication device, emergency beacon, credentials)
  * Prototype "Echo Chamber" device (similar to the one received by the Cascadia photographer)
  * Department handbook, 6th edition

## Current Objective
* Investigating emerging temporal echoes in the Portland area that appear connected to the Cascadia incident, specifically tracing acoustic signatures that might reveal the origin point of the F-16 that carried out the airstrike

## Notes
* Carries a pocket notebook with handwritten frequency values she believes correspond to significant historical events
* Occasionally experiences brief auditory hallucinations she calls "previews" - sounds from events that haven't happened yet
* Has a collection of vintage vinyl records she claims sound slightly different each time they're played
* Refuses to use digital audio compression of any kind, insisting it "damages the temporal fabric"
