# The Department

## Definition
* An organization working with the VM to prevent catastrophic, world-ending outcomes
* Not affiliated with any country, international organization, or multinational - it might not even exist yet, from our perspective in time

## Capabilities and Limitations
1. **Resource Structure**: Possesses phenomenal resources - like, ridiculous, stupid amounts of money and information. Unfortunately, insofar as money and information are the same thing, this is all it has.
2. **Operational Constraints**: Can only inform, incentivize, and influence - cannot directly control. Land, minerals, energy, or corporeal agency are not assets it can tap into.
3. **Verification Role**: Performs "bespoke manual verification" of world state changes, updating the outcomes contract when necessary
4. **Field Operations**: Brings VM nodes into the field to test for new paystreams - if you calibrate the dimensions of your hypercert *just right*, one can just do things and follow the money

## Temporal Nature
* One widely published hypothesis is the 'forking paths' interpretation: the Department is an inter-dimensional agency
* If a world-ending event "happens" on the Department's branch, all *other* timelines update their value matrix
* Activities that prevent apocalypse in other timelines become more lucrative
* Because the VM is bigger than our temporal perspective, the "updated" VM always was that way from our vantage point
