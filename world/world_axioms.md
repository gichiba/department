# World Axioms

1. Time is a three-dimensional vector space. Not an arrow, but a donut.
   1a. The first dimension is motion through classic spacetime, or *duration*.
   1b. The second dimension is motion through assembly space, or *novelty*. 
   1c. The third dimension is motion through normative possibility space, or *will*. 

2. Morality or normative truth is orthogonal to the other two timespace dimensions.

3. Humans have a limited perspective of the world. Individual observers perceive timespace as spacetime. Spacetime is the traditional physical framework of three-dimensional space and one dimension of time.
