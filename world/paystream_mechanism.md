# Paystreams

## Definition
* Financial incentives flowing from actions that change the state of the world
* Connected to the outcomes contract which interfaces with the Values Matrix
* Funding comes from the largest cluster of zkapital pools on the net - enormous asset pools that zk-fund all sorts of projects
* Zero-knowledge proofs obscure the source of funds

## Properties
1. **Incentive Alignment**: Rewards actions that work against large, looming forces of evil
2. **Verification Requirements**: As the state of the world changes, the world state object is updated. Most updating is automated or mechanized, but occasionally new paystreams open up for "bespoke manual verification"
3. **Fieldwork**: New paystreams can be discovered by bringing the node into the field, where full sync is impossible, and *trying stuff* to see if any new paystreams open up as a result of your changes to the state of the world

## Historical Notes
* In the early days of discovery, hedge funds tried to use the nodes for "white collar time arbitrage," but it's a fool's errand now
* One by one, *every* hedge fund that tried to mess with time was undone - they made lots of money until the black swan came for them
* It was uncanny how systematic shifts in both capital supply and consumer demands crushed the (de)financial establishment
