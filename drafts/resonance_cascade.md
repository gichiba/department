# Resonance Cascade

## Echoes of Cascadia

The resonance appeared exactly where my calculations predicted: 47.6062° N, 122.3321° W. Capitol Hill, Seattle. Almost three years to the day after the airstrike that killed half the Cascadia Interim Executive Council. I set up my equipment under a tattered awning as the persistent Northwest drizzle dampened my shoulders and fogged my glasses.

My fingers moved on autopilot, laying out each component with practiced precision. The Nagra III—my most trusted companion—came out first. I carefully placed it on a folding table sheltered from the rain, its worn metal case still warm from being nestled against my side. Next came the tuning forks, the ECM-999 microphone, and finally, the Echo Chamber—the Department's sleek contribution to my otherwise vintage kit.

"You're wasting your time with that analog crap," called out a voice behind me. I didn't need to turn around to know it was Decker, one of the Department's drone operators who'd been assigned to "assist" me. What he meant was "monitor."

"Says the guy who flies a manual quadcopter because he doesn't trust the AI autopilot," I replied, still focused on threading a fresh reel of tape.

"That's different," he huffed, folding up his tablet and stepping under my makeshift shelter. "The drones get confused in rain."

I didn't continue the debate. After eight months with the Department, I'd learned when to conserve energy. Instead, I checked my Seiko chronometer—another anachronism the others loved to mock—and noted the time in my field journal: 18:42:17 Pacific.

"We've got eleven minutes until the temporal window opens," I said, handing Decker a set of headphones. "You'll want these."

He looked at them skeptically. "What am I listening for?"

"The past," I said simply, then added, "and possibly the future."

I'd tried explaining acoustic chronometry to non-specialists before. It never went well. How do you describe the sound of time folding back on itself? The way certain frequencies resonate across months and years, creating ripples that flow both forward and backward? It's like trying to describe color to someone who's never seen. The Department recruited me because I could hear these things. They didn't need to understand how.

As the minute hand on my chronometer approached 18:53, I flipped the switches on the Nagra and adjusted the input levels. The tape began to roll with that satisfying mechanical purr that digital recorders could never replicate. I turned on the Echo Chamber, its matte black housing now displaying wavelength patterns in soft blue light.

"Get ready," I whispered, more to myself than to Decker.

At precisely 18:53:42, it happened. A low thrumming sound emanated from the air itself—not from any visible source. It started below human hearing range, but I could feel it in my chest, in my teeth. The Echo Chamber's display confirmed what my body already knew: we were experiencing a temporal fold.

Decker yanked off the headphones. "What the hell was that?"

I didn't answer, too focused on adjusting the Nagra's speed to match the emerging pattern. As the sound climbed into audible range, it brought with it fragments of the past—snippets of conversations, the distant hum of Scantron machines, and underneath it all, the unmistakable rumble of jet engines.

"This is it," I muttered, my heart racing. "This is the moment."

Through my headphones came a sound I'd heard countless times in the Department archives: the photographer's camera shutter clicking. The one who had captured the F-16 streaking toward Capitol Hill. The Department's first documented modern farfetcher, though he hadn't known it at the time.

But then something unexpected happened. Another sound layered over the familiar one—a second camera shutter, slightly out of sync. I frowned, adjusting the dials on the Echo Chamber.

"What's wrong?" Decker asked, noticing my expression.

"There's an anomaly," I said. "A second photographer. Someone else captured the moment."

The implications were staggering. If someone else had photographed the F-16, taken evidence of the attack on Cascadia independently of our known farfetcher, why hadn't that image surfaced? Where was this second photographer now?

Before I could process this further, the Echo Chamber's display shifted dramatically. The blue wavelengths twisted into a spiral pattern I'd never seen before. The device began to heat up, its sleek housing now uncomfortably warm against my palm.

"That's not supposed to happen," Decker observed unnecessarily.

The sound in my headphones changed too. No longer were we hearing echoes of the past. What came through now was something else entirely—voices discussing events that hadn't yet occurred, planning sessions for operations still months away. And most disturbingly, I heard my own voice, describing findings from an investigation I hadn't yet conducted.

I ripped off my headphones just as the Echo Chamber emitted a high-pitched whine. Its display flickered once, then went dark. The temporal window had closed, but not before doing something I'd never witnessed in all my months of field work: it had burned information directly onto my analog tape.

"Did you get anything useful?" Decker asked as I began packing up my equipment, hands trembling slightly.

"More than useful," I said quietly. "I think I just recorded a conversation from six months in the future."

Back in my hotel room, I spent hours analyzing the recording. The first half was expected—the ambient sounds of the election day, the fateful moment when the F-16 appeared in the photographer's viewfinder. But the second half contained something else entirely. As I transcribed the future conversation captured on my tape, a pattern emerged that made my skin crawl.

"...asset in place since before Cascadia fell..."
"...second image confirms timeline manipulation..."
"...the Department wasn't observing; it was *orchestrating*..."

I stopped writing and stared at my notebook. The accusation hung in the air, impossible to ignore. The Department—*my* Department—had known about the attack before it happened. Worse, the conversation suggested they may have played a role in it.

This couldn't be right. I'd dedicated my life to understanding temporal anomalies, to helping the Department document farfetchings. We were observers, not manipulators. We didn't *create* history; we studied it.

Yet the evidence was literally in my hands. My modified Nagra had captured something that defied my understanding of our mission. Either I was misinterpreting the recording, or everything I thought I knew about the Department was wrong.

I glanced at the Echo Chamber, still lifeless after its unusual behavior at the site. I should report the malfunction, hand over my findings to Director Chen. That was protocol.

Instead, I decided to make a copy of the tape. Just in case.

My Nagra whirred softly as it duplicated the recording onto a fresh reel. Halfway through the process, I heard something at my door—the faint click of the electronic lock disengaging. I hadn't ordered room service, and Decker wouldn't come by this late. I quickly slipped the original tape into my pocket and turned to face whoever was entering.

The door swung open to reveal a face I recognized instantly, though we'd never met. The photographer from Cascadia—the original farfetcher whose image had exposed the attack. He looked older than in his file photo, with new lines around his eyes and a wary set to his shoulders. But it was unmistakably him.

"Aria Matsuda," he said, not a question but a confirmation. "We need to talk."

I found myself nodding, even as questions flooded my mind. How did he find me? Why now? And most importantly—how did he know exactly when to appear?

"I've been expecting you," I lied, trying to project a confidence I didn't feel. "But you're early."

He smiled faintly at that, stepping into the room and closing the door behind him. "No," he said, looking pointedly at my chronometer. "I'm right on time. The Department has been lying to both of us, and I think you just figured that out."

As if on cue, the duplicate tape finished recording. The Nagra's motor stopped, leaving us in relative silence. Only then did I notice the device in his hand—identical to my Echo Chamber, but with a modification I didn't recognize.

"That conversation you just recorded?" he said. "I'm the one who sent it back to you. Six months from now. Which means we have exactly that long to figure out what the Department is really doing with our farfetchings—and stop them before they orchestrate something worse than Cascadia."

I should have been skeptical, should have demanded proof. But the temporal tension was unmistakable. Logic told me this was impossible, but intuition—the same sense that had guided my most accurate predictions—told me he was right.

I pulled out my notebook and opened to a fresh page.

"Start from the beginning," I said.
