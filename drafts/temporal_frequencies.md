# Temporal Frequencies

## The Tokyo Anomaly

Aria Matsuda stood motionless in the center of Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, her eyes closed amid the rush of morning commuters. To anyone watching, she might have appeared lost in thought or perhaps listening to music through invisible earbuds. In reality, she was working.

The station's acoustics created a perfect temporal echo chamber. Three hundred thousand people moved through it daily, their footsteps, conversations, and the mechanical sounds of trains arriving and departing all blending into a sonic tapestry that most perceived as mere noise. But to Aria, it was data—frequencies and patterns that revealed temporal disturbances invisible to ordinary perception.

"Anything?" The voice in her earpiece belonged to Director Chen, monitoring the operation from the Department's Portland office.

"Not yet," Aria replied softly, adjusting the dial on her modified Nagra III recorder. The vintage Soviet-era device hung from a leather strap across her shoulder, its metallic housing warm against her side. "But the morning Yamanote Line arrival is when historical records show the anomaly peaked."

Three weeks ago, a Department observer had reported unusual temporal readings at this exact spot. Initial analysis suggested a connection to the Cascadia event—specifically, to communications that might have originated from Tokyo in the hours before the airstrike. Aria had been dispatched to investigate, returning to her former home for the first time since joining the Department.

The station's clock read 8:42. Aria opened her eyes and moved toward Track 5 where the next train would arrive in exactly six minutes. She checked her mechanical Seiko chronometer—a ritual that amused her Department colleagues who relied on satellite-synchronized digital timepieces. But Aria knew better. Digital time could be manipulated, the signal intercepted. Mechanical time maintained its own integrity.

"The calibration's off by 3.7 seconds," she murmured, making a minute adjustment to her chronometer.

"Does that matter?" Chen's voice carried a hint of impatience.

"It might." Aria positioned herself near the yellow safety line as the announcement for the approaching train echoed through the station. "Temporal precision is essential for an accurate reading."

She reached into her coat pocket and withdrew a set of tuning forks, each calibrated to resonate at frequencies associated with known temporal disturbances. As the train approached, she struck the middle fork against her palm and held it near the Echo Chamber device—the Department's sleek contribution to her otherwise vintage kit.

The device's display lit up with spiraling blue patterns. Aria's breath caught in her throat. This was it.

"I've got something," she said, watching as the temporal signature strengthened. "Definitely Department-grade. Someone's been here, manipulating the timeline."

The train doors opened, disgorging a flood of commuters. Aria narrowed her eyes, scanning the crowd. According to her briefing, she was looking for any anomalous behavior—someone moving against the flow, perhaps, or displaying awareness of the temporal distortion.

That's when she saw him: a tall man in a gray suit, carrying an analog camera that didn't belong in 2025. Not a smartphone or even a modern digital camera, but a film camera with a telephoto lens. She recognized the model instantly—a Pentax K1000, identical to the one used by the Cascadia photographer.

"Target identified," she said quietly, beginning to move through the crowd. "Male, approximately 180cm, gray suit, carrying a Pentax K1000."

"The same model?" Chen's voice sharpened with interest.

"Exact same. This can't be coincidence." Aria kept her distance, following the man as he exited the platform and headed toward the station's east exit.

As she followed, Aria reached into her bag and activated the Echo Chamber. Its display showed rippling patterns that indicated temporal distortion surrounding the target. This wasn't just someone carrying an old camera—this was someone wrapped in the same kind of temporal anomaly that had surrounded the Cascadia farfetcher.

The man paused at a coffee kiosk, and Aria seized the opportunity. She approached casually, pretending to browse a nearby magazine stand while keeping him in her peripheral vision. The Echo Chamber readings intensified as she drew closer.

Then something unexpected happened. Without turning around, the man spoke in perfect Japanese: "The Department sent you sooner than expected, Ms. Matsuda."

Aria froze. He knew her name. He knew she was coming.

The man turned slowly, revealing features that matched no known Department profile in her briefing. He looked Japanese, perhaps in his mid-fifties, with steel-gray hair and eyes that seemed to evaluate and dismiss her in the same moment.

"You might want to switch off that device," he continued in Japanese, nodding toward the Echo Chamber in her bag. "It's alerting others to your presence."

"Who are you?" Aria asked, keeping her voice level even as her mind raced through possibilities.

The man smiled thinly. "Someone who understands what the Department is really doing with farfetchings." He glanced at his watch—an antique mechanical piece that Aria immediately recognized as a pre-war Seiko, similar to but older than her own. "We have four minutes before the temporal window closes. That's enough time for me to show you something that will change everything you think you know."

Aria's training dictated that she should alert Chen immediately, but curiosity—her persistent weakness—won out. "Show me what?"

The man removed a small notebook from his breast pocket and handed it to her. Aria opened it cautiously, her eyes widening as she recognized the handwriting—her own. Pages of frequency notations, temporal coordinates, and observations she had never written.

"That's your field journal," the man said quietly. "From six months in your future."

Aria flipped through the pages, scanning entries dated weeks and months ahead. The final entry described this very meeting, including details she couldn't possibly have known in advance.

"This is impossible," she whispered.

"No more impossible than what happened in Cascadia." The man nodded toward the station exit. "The Department told you they're observing temporal anomalies. The truth is they're creating them. I can prove it, but not here. We need to move before the window closes."

Aria's hand hovered over her communication device. Logic told her to report in, to follow protocol. But the journal in her hands—filled with her own distinctive notations and the unmistakable pattern of her handwriting—triggered that intuitive sense she had learned to trust. The same sense that had first identified the spectral echo patterns now used by the Department.

"Director Chen," she said into her earpiece, decision made. "Target lost in the crowd. I'm continuing to track the temporal signature."

She switched off the device before Chen could respond and looked at the man with the Pentax. "You have until the window closes to convince me."

He nodded once, satisfaction and relief briefly crossing his features. "This way."

They exited the station into Tokyo's morning sunlight. As they walked, the man explained how he had been tracking Department activities across multiple timeframes—past, present, and several potential futures.

"The Cascadia incident wasn't just observed by the Department," he said. "It was engineered. A controlled farfetching designed to test their ability to influence political outcomes through targeted temporal manipulation."

"That's not possible," Aria argued. "Farfetchings are spontaneous temporal phenomena. They can't be manufactured."

The man stopped walking and turned to face her. "Then how do you explain this?"

He raised his Pentax and pointed toward the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in the distance. As Aria watched, the massive structure seemed to shimmer slightly, its outline blurring for just a moment before resolidifying—but with subtle differences. The angle of the twin towers had changed by perhaps two degrees, and a helipad that hadn't been there before now adorned the roof.

"What did you just do?" Aria demanded, instinctively reaching for her tuning forks. The middle one was already vibrating in her pocket.

"I didn't do anything," the man replied. "The Department did. Thirty seconds ago, they activated a temporal adjustment node in Shinjuku. They're making small changes, testing the limits of what they can alter without creating noticeable ripple effects."

Aria's Echo Chamber confirmed his claim, its display showing the distinctive pattern of an artificial temporal shift—something she had only seen in theoretical simulations during her Department training.

"Why show me this?" she asked. "If what you're saying is true, I'm working for the very people you're exposing."

The man's expression softened slightly. "Because according to that journal you're holding, you're the one who helps me stop them." He checked his watch again. "The window is closing. You have a choice to make, Ms. Matsuda. Return to the Department with a sanitized report about a false lead in Tokyo, or come with me and learn what your future self already knows."

Aria looked down at the journal, then at her Nagra III recorder—the device that had first allowed her to hear the patterns in time that others missed. She thought about the spectral echo she had documented during the Cascadia conflict, how it had preceded the digital infrastructure failure by exactly 73 seconds. At the time, she had believed it was a natural phenomenon she had been lucky enough to capture.

Now she wasn't so sure.

"Where would we go?" she asked.

"To see the man who took the Cascadia photograph," he replied. "He's been hiding in Kyoto since the Department's first attempt to recruit him failed."

Aria's pulse quickened. The Cascadia photographer—the Department's first documented farfetcher—was here in Japan?

The tuning fork in her pocket had stopped vibrating. The temporal window was closed. Time to decide.

"I need my equipment," she said finally.

The man nodded, seeming unsurprised by her decision. "Of course. You'll need it to verify everything I'm about to show you."

As they walked toward the subway that would take them to Tokyo Station and the shinkansen to Kyoto, Aria felt the weight of the journal in her coat pocket. Whatever she was walking into, her future self had already experienced it—had documented it meticulously in the very style she used for all her field recordings.

Either this was the most elaborate deception ever attempted against a Department field observer, or everything she believed about her work was about to change. Either way, she would approach it as she approached all temporal anomalies: with precise measurement, careful documentation, and the delicate balance between logical analysis and intuitive understanding that had defined her career.

The man with the Pentax walked slightly ahead, navigating the crowded streets with the confidence of someone who knew exactly where the currents of time would take them. Aria followed, her hand resting on the Nagra III at her side, ready to record whatever came next in this unfolding temporal mystery.
