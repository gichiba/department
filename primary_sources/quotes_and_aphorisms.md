The garden is one of man's attempts to impose his own principles of order, utility, and beauty on nature. What grows in the garden is always a small, consciously selected sample of what *might* be grown there. "

## Aphorisms

An object is anything that can be *built* or *broken*. 

Hyperobjects are objects are sticky, non-local objects massively distributed in space and time. We are all trapped inside them.

The *how* **is** the *what*. 

The only way *out* is *through*. 

The whole is actually *less than* the sum of its parts.

Cypherpunks write code. Solarpunks build public goods. Lunarpunks break public evils.
